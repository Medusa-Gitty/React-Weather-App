This project is about building a web application to show a weather forecast using weather API from external services [Open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/). Here you will be able to search for a specific location in the world and also it will automatically detect your current location in the beginning (for that you need to allow location) and will display all the important weather details.

I have used Redux Toolkits for storing state variables and the reducers for dispatching actions, You can get a UI feeback depending of the temperature whether it is chilly or hot. Get your current location weather thanks to Google Geo location.

To use the app, you will be prompted to allow user location, you can still use the app by searching for the city or selecting any of the default tabs.


## ðŸš€ Features
- Saving the weather data in redux-store to reduce the dependency of network requests
- Search weather details according to the city
- Detect your current location for displaying weather data
- Toast notification for every action
- Responsive for every screen size.
- UI feedback for the weather if it is chilly or hot.
